            Hi! Welcome to my page.
            </p>
            <p>
            My name is Kamila Skopinska, and I'm a creative jack of all trades. I'm currently working as a Graphic Designer,
            and studying Software Development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have a diploma in UX Design, a BCs in Game Art & Design, and experience
            working as a freelance 3D sculptor.
            I’m dedicated, organized, very precise about all my work, and I’m a great team player,
            who genuinely loves the challenge of working under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my non professional life, I'm a big bug nerd, love reading, anything DIY, and have
            more hobbies than I can count. 
</p>
<p>
